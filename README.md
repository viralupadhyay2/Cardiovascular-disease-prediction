# Cardiovascular-disease-prediction
This project focuses on developing a hybrid deep learning model to predict cardiovascular diseases (CVD) efficiently and accurately. By leveraging state-of-the-art machine learning techniques, the system processes patient data to identify potential indicators of heart disease, reducing the time and effort required for traditional diagnostic methods.

The model integrates Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for feature extraction, Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks for sequential data processing, and an Attention Layer to prioritize critical features for prediction. This hybrid architecture is designed to deliver high precision and reliability, with potential applications in real-world healthcare systems.
